# Bloodthirst

Bloodthirst is a single player FPS game, kinda like doom with the cranked game mode from call of duty.

It was built in the span of 48 hours as part of the Ludum Dare 51 game jam, submitted as part of Compo. The theme of the jam was 'every 10 seconds'.

You can play it on my itch page: https://nearnoah.itch.io/bloodthirst

Description:

Are you ready?  This is what you’ve been trained for. The effluvia is thick, from our analysis, you should have around 10 seconds before you feel the effects driving you into thirst. Kill all the bloodzerks, or as many as you can to reach evac in one piece. Whatever you do, dont let yourself go past the edge of lust, you dont want to end up a ‘zerk. Good luck.
